## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Server not responding?
```bash
# Check if server is running
# Look for "Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000"

# If not, restart:
. venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
python app.py
```

### "local_data.json" errors?
- File will be created automatically
- If corrupted, delete it and restart

### Can't login after registration?
- Check `local_data.json` to verify user was created
- Ensure password is at least 8 characters
